# advent-code-2022
Repo to contain all Advent of Code 2022 Coding Challenges

On vacation for about two months and figured I might as well do the Advent of Code this year and get better at go

https://adventofcode.com/

Most commit mesages are my thoughts on the day, should have down readmes per day or something more organized but really didnt know how much I would do, or even the format when I started

Some pretty messy code in here as I started with a bare grasp of Go and had to look up how to do everything the first day. Also due to being in China and the proxy, I didnt figure out how to get external libraries in
until like day 16?. Used them, and had gotten really used to it since then so just moved forward without them.

Cleaned up some of the most egregious spots during a day of downtime, but overall, feel like cleaning it up afterwards is a little against the spirit. Code it and own it, thats how you figured out how to do it.

Never resolved the local import...whoops

Doing all this on a surface pro 4 was almost an advantage? Made me start thinking about time earlier.

Was over 24h on 4 days. Last two because Xiangli and I were touring Lijiang.

Overall, fun? I guess. Some days were just really annoying, i think there was 4/5 days that boiled down to "do bfs, but different"
